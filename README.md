# Sock Automation Lab Project

Welcome to the Sock Automation Lab project! This project aims to create a fully functional home lab environment for SOC (Security Operations Center) automation, including components such as Wasuh for simulation, TheHive for case management, and Shuffle for SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response capabilities.

## Introduction

The Sock Automation Lab project is designed to configure and automating a simulated SOC environment. The aim of this project is to configure various components to work together, generate telemetry data, trigger alerts, and integrate with case management systems.

## Features

- Comprehensive setup guide for creating your own SOC automation lab.
- Integration of Wasuh for simulation, TheHive for case management, and Shuffle for SOAR capabilities.
- Step-by-step tutorials for configuring servers, generating telemetry, triggering alerts, and integrating components.
- Opportunities for customization and automation using scripting.
